# Perspective Taker

Perspective Taker is a tool that helps you understand different perspectives on a topic or put your existing beliefs to the test.

The app is built off of the Philosophy Catalog of Epistemic Me, by enabling users to select a philosophy and then use it as a perpsective that guides how they investigate a given topic. 

Users can preload their existing beliefs, through specifying an existing self model, and then engage in dialogue with the app.

Users can also select multiple perspectives for dialogue, and the app will generate a dialogue that explores the topic from the multiple perspectives. The system works by generating a dialogue between the user and the app, where the user is the protagonist and the app is the antagonist. The app will generate a dialogue that explores the topic from the multiple perspectives.

In each round of dialogue, the user will specify which perspective they agree with and the app will in turn update the beleif of the self model for the dialogue that corresponds to the perspective that the user agrees with.

At the end of the dialogue, the app will generate a report of the user's prior beliefs and the app's beliefs, and the user can see the difference between the two.
