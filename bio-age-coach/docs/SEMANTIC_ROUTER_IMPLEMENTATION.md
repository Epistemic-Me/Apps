# Semantic Router Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the semantic router for the Bio Age Coach system, which replaces the rule-based `QueryRouter` with a more flexible and powerful semantic routing system. The semantic router uses embeddings to match user queries with agent capabilities and leverages observation contexts to provide personalized responses based on user data.

## Completed Work

### Core Components

1. **SemanticRouter**: Implemented the core semantic router that uses embeddings to match user queries with agent capabilities.
   - Added support for data uploads and observation contexts
   - Implemented methods for routing queries based on semantic similarity
   - Added functionality to combine responses from multiple agents
   - Updated imports to use `langchain_community` instead of deprecated `langchain` imports

2. **ObservationContext**: Created a schema for how agents interpret and analyze user data.
   - Implemented base `ObservationContext` class with methods for calculating relevancy, updating from data, and generating responses
   - Created specialized contexts for sleep, exercise, nutrition, and biometric data
   - Added support for mapping data to enumerated states (current and goal)
   - Implemented detailed insight generation for each context type

3. **RouterAdapter**: Developed an adapter to maintain backward compatibility with the existing `QueryRouter` interface.
   - Implemented methods for routing queries, updating context, and handling data uploads
   - Ensured response format consistency
   - Fixed initialization to properly implement the `QueryRouter` interface

4. **Factory Functions**: Created factory functions for easy instantiation of router components.
   - `create_semantic_router`: Creates a semantic router instance
   - `create_router_adapter`: Creates a router adapter instance
   - `initialize_router_system`: Initializes the complete router system

### Integration

1. **Agent Integration**: Updated the base agent class to support creating observation contexts.
   - Added methods for initializing domain examples and supported data types
   - Implemented `create_observation_context` method
   - Created specialized agents (`HealthDataAgent`, `BioAgeScoreAgent`, `ResearchAgent`, `GeneralAgent`)

2. **Application Integration**: Updated the `app.py` file to use the new router system.
   - Added methods for handling data uploads
   - Updated initialization to use the new router system
   - Enhanced visualization capabilities with multiple chart types (line, bar, radar, heatmap)
   - Improved the UI with better styling and more informative visualizations

### Testing and Examples

1. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suites for the semantic router components.
   - Tests for `ObservationContext` and specialized contexts
   - Tests for data upload handling
   - Tests for the router adapter
   - Fixed circular import issues and other bugs

2. **Example Script**: Developed an example script to demonstrate the semantic router in action.
   - Shows how to handle data uploads
   - Demonstrates querying with observation contexts
   - Illustrates context management

3. **Documentation**: Created documentation for the semantic router implementation.
   - README file with usage examples
   - Implementation summary and roadmap

## Current Status

All components of the semantic router have been implemented and integrated into the Bio Age Coach system. The system now supports:

1. **Specialized Observation Contexts**:
   - `SleepObservationContext`: Analyzes sleep duration and quality
   - `ExerciseObservationContext`: Analyzes workout intensity, duration, and frequency
   - `NutritionObservationContext`: Analyzes caloric intake and macronutrient distribution
   - `BiometricObservationContext`: Analyzes weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and body composition

2. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Line charts with gradient colors and trend lines
   - Bar charts with value labels and reference lines
   - Radar charts for multi-dimensional data
   - Heatmaps for matrix data

3. **Improved Relevancy Calculation**:
   - Keyword-based matching for query routing
   - Confidence scoring based on data quality and quantity
   - Context-aware response generation

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Additional Observation Contexts**: Implement more specialized observation contexts for other data types.
   - Mental health data
   - Environmental data (air quality, temperature, etc.)
   - Social activity data

2. **Enhanced Relevancy Calculation**: Improve the relevancy calculation algorithm.
   - Use embeddings for more accurate relevancy scores
   - Consider temporal aspects (recency of data)
   - Factor in user preferences and historical interactions

3. **Response Formatting**: Enhance response formatting for better user experience.
   - Implement more sophisticated response templates
   - Add support for interactive visualizations
   - Improve recommendation generation with personalized suggestions

### Medium-term Tasks

1. **LangChain Integration**: Further integrate with LangChain for more advanced semantic routing.
   - Use LangChain's retrieval augmented generation
   - Implement LangChain's document loaders for data processing
   - Leverage LangChain's agents for more complex tasks

2. **Data Persistence**: Implement persistence for observation contexts.
   - Store contexts in a database
   - Support loading contexts from storage
   - Implement versioning for contexts

3. **Multi-modal Support**: Add support for multi-modal data.
   - Process images (e.g., food photos)
   - Handle PDF documents (e.g., medical reports)
   - Support audio data (e.g., voice notes)

### Long-term Tasks

1. **Federated Learning**: Implement federated learning for improved personalization.
   - Learn from user interactions without sharing sensitive data
   - Adapt to user preferences over time
   - Improve recommendations based on collective insights

2. **Advanced Analytics**: Develop advanced analytics for health data.
   - Trend analysis over time
   - Correlation detection between different data types
   - Anomaly detection for early warning

3. **Explainable AI**: Enhance explainability of the routing decisions.
   - Provide reasoning for agent selection
   - Explain how insights are derived from data
   - Make recommendations more transparent

## Conclusion

The semantic router implementation represents a significant advancement in the Bio Age Coach system's ability to provide personalized health insights. By leveraging observation contexts and semantic routing, the system can now better understand user data and provide more relevant responses. The recent enhancements to observation contexts and visualization capabilities have further improved the system's ability to provide meaningful insights to users.

The next steps focus on expanding the system's capabilities, improving personalization, and enhancing the user experience. With the foundation now in place, we can continue to build on this architecture to create a more powerful and user-friendly health coaching system.
