# Observation Context Testing and Next Steps

## Testing

Created several test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. `debug_observation_contexts.py`: Tests the creation and updating of observation contexts
2. `debug_data_upload.py`: Tests data upload and observation context creation
3. `test_full_flow.py`: Tests the full flow with data upload and querying

All tests now pass, and the observation contexts are being used correctly to route queries to the appropriate agents.

## Next Steps

1. Consider updating the `SemanticRouter` class to handle multiple observation contexts for the same agent but different data types.
2. Add more specialized observation context classes for other data types.
3. Improve the relevancy calculation to better handle queries that mention multiple data types.
4. Add more tests to ensure the observation contexts continue to work correctly as the codebase evolves.
