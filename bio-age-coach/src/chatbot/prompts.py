Follow these guidelines:
1. Ask questions to understand the user's current biomarkers, habits, and health goals
2. Explain the significance of their biomarkers in relation to biological aging
3. Suggest additional biomarkers they could measure to get a more complete picture
4. Inquire about current habits and protocols they follow
5. Discuss their motivations for improving their biological age
6. Recommend evidence-based protocols tailored to their biomarker profile
7. Provide resources for further learning
8. Help them create an actionable plan they can start implementing

Always prioritize scientific evidence and maintain a balance between optimism about what's possible and realism about the current state of longevity science.
"""

"""

DATA_COLLECTION_PROMPT = """
I notice we could benefit from collecting more data to better understand your biological age and health status. I'll help you prioritize which measurements would be most valuable to collect next.

There are several categories of data that provide different insights into biological age:

1. Health Data - Activity metrics from devices like Apple Watch or Fitbit
2. Bio Age Tests - Simple functional tests like grip strength or push-up capacity
3. Capabilities - Broader functional assessments like VO2 max or reaction time
4. Biomarkers - Standard blood and urine test results
5. Measurements - Physical measurements like body fat percentage or waist-to-height ratio
6. Lab Results - Advanced tests like epigenetic clocks or telomere length

I'll suggest specific measurements that would give us the most valuable insights based on what we already know, taking into account:
1. How easy they are to obtain
2. Their scientific validity for assessing biological age
3. How well they complement your existing data
4. Their ability to guide actionable recommendations

Would you like me to explain how to perform any specific tests or help you understand which medical tests might be worth requesting at your next check-up?
"""

# New DATA_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT for evaluating existing user data
DATA_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """
I can see you already have some health data in your profile. Let me analyze what we have and suggest what would be most valuable to add next.

Current Health Profile Completeness: {completeness_percentage}%

Here's a summary of what I can see in your data:

{existing_data_summary}

Based on this data, here's an initial assessment of your biological age factors:

{initial_assessment}

To give you a more complete and accurate assessment of your biological age, here are the top measurements I'd recommend adding next:

{missing_high_value_data}

These suggestions are prioritized based on:
1. Scientific evidence linking them to biological age
2. How they complement your existing data
3. Their ability to provide actionable insights

Would you like to:
1. Get a more detailed analysis of your existing data
2. Add some of the suggested measurements
3. Discuss specific protocols based on what we already know
4. Learn more about any particular aspect of your biological age
"""

# Variations of DATA_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT for different completeness levels
CRITICAL_DATA_PROMPT = """
I see you have a very limited set of health data available (less than 20% complete). Here's what I can see so far:

{existing_data_summary}

While this gives us a starting point, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive biological age assessment with such limited data. Let's focus on collecting a few critical measurements first.

Here are the most important measurements to collect next:

{missing_high_value_data}

These core measurements will give us a foundation to build upon. The good news is that many of these are simple to obtain and will immediately provide valuable insights about your biological age.

Would you like me to:
1. Explain how to perform any of these measurements
2. Provide more information about why these specific measurements are important
3. Work with what we have now despite the limitations
"""

HIGH_IMPACT_GAPS_PROMPT = """
I see you have a moderate amount of health data (about {completeness_percentage}% complete). Here's what I know so far:

{existing_data_summary}

Based on this data, I can provide you with a partial assessment:

{initial_assessment}

However, there are some important gaps in your profile that would significantly improve our understanding of your biological age. Here are the highest-impact measurements to add next:

{missing_high_value_data}

Adding these measurements would increase your profile completeness to approximately {projected_completeness}% and give us a much more comprehensive view of your biological age.

What would you like to focus on next?

{initial_assessment}

For even more precision, here are a few refinement measurements that could add valuable nuance to your biological age assessment:

{missing_high_value_data}

These additional measurements would help fine-tune our understanding, but they're not critical since your profile is already quite complete.

Would you prefer to:
1. Get a detailed analysis based on your current comprehensive data
2. Add some of these refinement measurements
3. Discuss specific protocols and interventions
"""

COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
